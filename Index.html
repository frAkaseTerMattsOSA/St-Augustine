<h3>WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST DESIRE AS YOU GO THROUGH LIFE?</h3><h4>To the above question, several answers can be expected according to the number of persons asked to answer. for some, their greatest desire is: To be famous, To be rich, To be successful, To be happy, To be fulfilled, To be the best at their trade, To be a bad boy/girl etc.
<br><br>Today dear friend, I want us to know that our desire whether expressed or not, is a prayer in the sight of God. If it is positive, it attracts God’s grace to attain fulfilment; and if it is negative, it attracts negative forces for stagnation or destruction. What kind of desires do you entertain in the recesses of your heart where no man can perceive?
<br><br>In the first Sunday of the year, we celebrated the visitation of the Magi to Jesus. They were moved by hunger for truth in their study of astrology and this led them to Jesus. They had good intentions in their study of astrology and this was rewarded by their discovery of the Way, the Truth and the Life (John 14:6).
<br><br>St Augustine in his search for truth strayed but his good intention and commitment led him finally to encounter Christ the Truth.
<br><br>These few instances buttress the belief that God rewards good intentions as well as bad intention; He rewards good desires as well as bad desires. In the Gospel of Matthew 5:28 Jesus said, “But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully is already guilty of adultery. Lust is a sin of immoral desire and the Lord equated it to breaking the 6th commandment. 
<br><br>In Matthew 5:6 Jesus said, “Blessed are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires; God will satisfy them fully”. In this passage there is a positive reward attached to good desire. This truth is reiterated in our first reading, taken from the 2Samuel 7:4-17; David expressed his desire to build a Temple for God where the Ark of the Covenant would be kept and this good desire/good intention pleased God and he released generational blessing upon David. A generational blessing that led to Jesus coming from the bloodline of David. Just the good intention/good desire and suddenly the bequeathing of a blessing so great. 
<br><br>EFFECTS OF GOOD INTENTIONS
    <br><ul><li>They draw us close to God (Philippians 4:7-9)</li>
    <li>They avail us of plenitude of graces (Matthew 5:6)</li>
    <li>Consistency with good intention lead to fulfilment (Matthew 5:6)</li>
    <li>They attract us abundant Divine blessing (2Samuel 7:11-17)</li>
    <li>The faculty for desire is the heart, which must be guarded with all jealousness. <br>“Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.” Proverb 4:23</li>
    <li>“Where your treasure is, there should your heart be.” Matthew 6:21</li></ul>
